national team first analysis : 

backround :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

we have 3 df  of national teams 
goalscorers
results
shootouts

stage 1 : 
go to stage 1 and play*******


a menu will open 
the user will choose which df he wants to see(or all of them) and he will get a short   description such as : 

1.show first rows.

2.how many rows and column the df has.

3.types of the columns. 

4.The number of missing values in each columns.

5.The number of duplicate rows.

6.the number of empty rows.

7.column population in %

beacsue of 7 i removed shootout df because the main puropse in this df is who is the scorer and most of the main purpose is not  populated (column first_shooter 34.06% populated)



if the user will press 2 he will continue to stage 2 .


================================================================================================================
stage 2 : 

1.cleansing will start.
  remove cuplidate rows
  drop empty rows
  and creating new boolean columns for is_home_win/is_away_win (win is True)
  as mentioned below i decided not to work with shootouts df because  lack of data.
3.after cleansing and add new columns,the user will choose how many **best teams**  he wants to see  (max of 5)
4.now the process will start to calculate :
 first df  results_copy  will be filtered only is_home_team=True
 second df results_copy  will be filtered only is_away_team=True

then i did group by team in order to see how many wins each team has home and away.
then i did inner merge on  team and sum home win+ away win 
now i will get team and number of total winnings.
(the head will be the input from the user max of 5 ) 

5.plot for total wins for each team (in parallel we have printing of team,winshome,winsaway,totalwins)
6.plot for away wins for each team .

7. the new df that iv'e created ,top_teams_chooser(team,total number of winnings)
will be merged with goalscorers df  by inner on team(that the user choose ) , and that in order to bring the team(that the user choose )   and minute of the goal .

8. plot_goal_distribution_per_min(in parallel will have printing of team,minute and below mentiond how many rows)
9.median plot of goal per team (in parallel will have a printing of mean,std,median and etc')
